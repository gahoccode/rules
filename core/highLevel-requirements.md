Data Preparation

Time Series Processing

Sort historical price data chronologically by date
Handle missing values through appropriate interpolation or removal
Calculate daily/monthly returns using pct_change() method
Remove NaN values with dropna() to ensure data integrity


Return Calculation

Convert raw price data to logarithmic or percentage returns
Align all asset return series to ensure consistent timeframes
Screen for outliers and extreme values that could skew optimization


Data Validation

Verify sufficient historical data for reliable optimization
Ensure minimum data quality standards are met for all selected assets
Provide warning for assets with insufficient trading history
